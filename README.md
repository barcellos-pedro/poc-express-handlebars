# Introduction

> Practice based on this [blog post](https://github.com/npmaile/blog/blob/main/posts/2.%20How%20to%20get%20into%20software.md#7-write-a-website-from-scratch-and-host-it-on-a-server-somewhere) from Nate Maile

This project was made to expose me to how to set up a server and deploy a web app.

Going through this process I learned valuable concepts and ideas about the development process beyond localhost.

During the journey I learned about cloud providers, domains, server plans, git, remote access to the server (ssh), process managers, observability and environments.
